# Unlock-Ball-Block-Puzzle
## Intro
My fathter loves to play mobile games. Recently he got stuck to an android game 'Unlock-Ball-Block-Puzzle' in level 37 and asked me if I could help him to cross the level. Well, I am not much of a 'game-guy', tried little bit and understood, I don't have much tolerance to solve a game's leve. So, I failed. But I got idea, why not use computer to solve the game! So, wrote the a code and solved it!.

## Level 37 
I basically mapped the tiles, like which can be connected to which and in which direction they can be connected to (upward, downward, left, right). Gave constraints like, you can not cross the grid (4 by 4, 0 based), you must visit such box( box(1,0) before final move etc.) in the game to complete it. Made a graph and solved it!.
